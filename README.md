> I spend most of the time working on the coding the logic in Node to get it to generate the Readme.md file correctly. This assignment were not as complicated as the others because I understood it much better. 
Applying Styling to Readme and test out license and badge took alot of time appending them to the correct place. It was took alot of time to go through at first but after reviewing and help from Instructor/TAs,
the logic became more clear and I was able to apply the concept and made it work.
